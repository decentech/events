# Events

#### The tech scene is awash with brand specific events. We're different by design.

#### Unifying Bitcoin, Bitchain, Ethereum, IPFS, Maidsafe, and other Open Source projects working on and with decentralised platforms: developing, launching and growing.

We take 3 consistent approaches:
* education - newbie or seasoned pro our events will be designed for you to receive tangible value
* overview - what's happening in the world of dapps (decentralised apps) - potential guest speaker
* community building - we will **actively** commit to growing dapps communities by showing precisely you can help contribute to an open source project

#### Like a bookclub but for decentralised tech projects. Each month we'll take a new focus, mentor others, learn together and share our knowledge.

#### Whether you spell it Decentralized or Decentralised, we have your back.
